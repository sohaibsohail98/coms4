Elevator pitch:

My name is Sohaib and I’m a recent graduate in Media and Communications, a degree which offers a unique approach towards team-working skills. something which is completely different to technology. I’ve had a passion for technology since I was very young because its a constantly changing field. Entering into the tech industry with no technical experience and knowledge seemed like an impossible mission. However, since joining the Sparta academy, I feel confident about learning new IT skills. Being introduced to the DevOps has been very exciting because it’s a chance to work with different departments and clients in order to perfect delivery projects. I’ve learnt various business skills, Python coding, and Github functions.  With my future in Sparta, I’m very excited to learn new IT technologies such as SQL, AWS and work with clients such as Home Office, Spotify, Bupa and Capgemini.

Things not to say:
- What are the benefits?
- What is the pay, I don’t want to move, how much holidays do I get?
- What are the working hours? 
- What type of progression can I expect? 
- This role is not for me 
- I rather be in another role


Presentation Skills (CMAD):
- Confidence - Knowledge of the subject, preparing and planning, rehearsing 
- Manner - Voice, appearance and movement
- Attitude - Attention to detail, aim for perfection
- Diligence
- Enthusiasm

Structuring a presentation:
- Intro and background
- Outline
- Sections - Lead in, content (rule of three - describe something in amounts of 3), summary/review
- Conclusion
- Summary
- Any questions

If you are presenting:
- Understand your audience

The Project Environment:
- Business as usual vs Project: BAU is the normal execution of standard operations within an organisation, a project is unique and short timed with a desired outcome
- Business as usual strategies - Optimisation - 9-5 simple information
- Project strategies - it’s more complex and detailed strategies
- Lifecycle of a project: Initiation, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, closing
- The triple constraint - Time, cost, quality 
- The POPIT model - People, Organisation, Technology Process
- Devops role in agile - we need to implement the code, 
- Project managed really well - deadlines can be managed well, divide the tasks, identify the risk and deal with it, 

Microservice architecture is better than monolithic architecture as if something goes down you can focus only on that part
 
Auto scaling = When one database goes down some organisations may have backup databases to keep the company running.
 
Another one is called HA (high availability), you have cloud space available in different areas in the world.

Software development cycles:
- Methodologies - Waterfall, V-Model, Agile
- Waterfall - System requirements, software requirements analysis, program design, coding, testing, operations
- Sudo coding - comments about the actual coding, eg: python


-Vmodel:

_Verification Process_
* Confirm that the systems fulfil the design requirements. 
* It is a measure of build. 
 
_Validation Process_
* Validation is the process of checking whether the specification captures the customer’s needs 
* It is a measure of performance.

-Agile (Iterative):
- Plan (Design), do (code), check (test) - this process is repeated repetitively. 

Stakeholders:

* Stakeholders are very important as they play a huge part in how an organisation progresses over time. 

* The objectives of stakeholders are different. It is important to compromise whenever necessary in order to reduce any conflict 

* Stakeholder management is essential to maintaining good working relationships in the workplace 

- Network diagrams provide a visual representation of the project workflow
- With the addition of time duration of each task, this can then be used to identify critical paths.
- Gantt chart - visual view of tasks scheduled over time
- While easier to read than Gantt, network diagrams are less detailed.
- Gantt charts display activities in a time frame.
- Each activity has a start date, duration, and end date.
- Gantt allows readers to see how activities relate to one another.
