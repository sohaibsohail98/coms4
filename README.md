# #Week 1 17/06:

Causes of conflict: 
- miscommunication
- differing goals
- stress
- resource limit
- personally clash
- styles of thinking
- difference in values, beliefs and opinions 

Broad approaches to conflict:

Nullifiers:
- Value harmony
- Positive relationships
- Don’t want to hurt feelings
- Stabilise team dynamics

Seekers:
- Eager to engage in disagreements
- Directness
- Honesty
- Lose patience when others aren’t as direct
- Doesn’t mind destabilising teams

Handling situations, teams and individuals:
- Take time to understand the situation - Listen to their view before reacting, don’t respond with a definitive standpoint too quickly.
- Know your audience - Are they a ‘Know it all’ or ‘closed-minded’, knowing that should change the way you deal with them
- Ask others for their perspective - Gain viewpoints from outside of the bubble
- Compromise - Find a resolution to satisfy both parties if you can, it’s fine to capitulate - this is not a battle

Neuro-Linguistic Programming:
- It’s a tool to analyse the psychology of a person, helping your behavioural and personal thoughts, and working environments. 
- It helps you think more clearly, communicate more effectively with others, manage the thoughts, moods and behaviour and medical benefits

NLP in the workplace:
- Problems are usually internal - work experiences are related to the individual than the workplace

Cognitive Bias:
- Too much information -
- Not enough meaning
- Need to act fast
- Outcome biased

Exploiting bias in the workplace:
- Reactance - By telling people they are able to say no will make them more likely to say yes
- Reciprocity - Be the first to give - the feeling of obligation to give when you receive, personalised and unexpected makes it even better
- Door in the face - forcing people to refuse a large request increases the likelihood of agreeing to a second smaller request
- Likability - Give compliments and build cooperation
- The bystander effect - people look to others to determine their own actions.

Actions within the workplace: 
- Don’t stereotype
- Be open to ideas outside of your existing beliefs 
- Stay level headed and treat people with respect
-
