# Week 1: 19/06
Scrum Artefact and Even:
- *Framework* to develop and sustaining complex products
- People can address complex adaptive problems - while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible values
- Scrum artefacts - elements that help you share vital project information with group members:
Each element:
-Scrum values
-Scrum events
-Scrum roles
Scrum - project management framework based on agile methodology
Increment - Sum of all product backlog

- Three key artefacts - 
-product backlog - list features of the product you’re developing, 
-spring backlog - describes what the team members should develop during sprint: - sprint retrospective
-product increment - product version delivered after each sprint to the stakeholders.

Scrum values - commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect
Scrum events - meetings that help teams discuss the development process - including sprint planning, daily scrum meeting, sprint review and sprint retrospective meeting
Scrum roles - Product owner, scrum master, development team 

Product owner - understand stakeholder needs and translated into product features: identify product features, does not need technical knowledge, keep the team in check, overseeing development process, product vision, management of product life cycle

Scrum master role - understand the principles of scrum and help the team out, should have the knowledge of agile values, supporting the product owner to realise the return on investment, encourage the team to be self-organised

Development team role - guiding people on the right path, two characteristics: 
self-organising - members know how to develop the product without any help from any non team member 
cross functional - all the skills required for product development and don’t have to depend on any non team member

Scrum principles: 
-Empiricism - Regularly check, monitor and adapt their workflows to make sure the project is heading in the right direction. 
-Self-organisation - be able to perform the tasks themselves without any input from non-team members
-Collaboration - interacting and working together to deliver high-quality increments
-Value based prioritisation - must prioritise the product 
-Time-boxing:*Time acts as a constraint in Scrum to help teams plan and execute the project efficiently.
-Iterative Development:*Scrum follows an iterative development model that helps teams include any change the customer needs in the product development process.

Network Diagrams:
-Task breakdown
-Estimation - different tasks will take different amounts of time. Keep a few days buffer, allows you to be on track
-Logical dependencies - Each task has a dependency on a previous task, some tasks are start-note which means it has no dependencies/predecessor 
-Network diagram allows us to see the logical order of activities and to define our critical path
If they are two starting points , you should start it with a 0 and then lead the other two points
-Activity on Node (AoD)
Earliest start ——- EST		!	Dur —— Duration
Latest time start — LST		!	Flt — Float

The time between latest start and earliest start = float
Early start + duration = Early start time
present latest start - duration of the predecessor note = Latest start of the predecessor note 
A critical part will be the one with zero free float
It is the longest path through the network - gives you a logical estimate on project length. 
The EST and LST is the same for end note
With multiple paths - use the maximum value note

The 2pm talk with Bruce Pentreath:
* He has been in the industry since 1996
* He used to sell ibm POS equipment
* They said pc would never impact POS equipment lol 
* Tata
* EDS
* Trends he has seen:
	* When new discoveries come around, people are always sceptical 
	* Tech is tech, what’s interesting is navigating the hype 
	* Hoffstrackers law?? (Check later) 
What is citizen source? how is it differnt to open source?
- Process control - 1986 built a IBM distribution system in automated sentries - similar to amazon distribution 
- Always look for something new, you are responsible for your own personal development, your own career, you can’t stay with the same career for 40 years. 
- Youtube video has changing programming, open world programs 
- Customer centric headline about innovation - amazon 
- Stick with the agile principles, Data management book of knowledge - international group 
- British IT society - skill of Information Age - SOIA 
- AIG - 1 billion budget a year - Private-cloud failed, lost 50 million, 
- Building information systems - using IOT to help build a feasible building and make sure it’s correct sizes .
- Adding value to the companies for job security - stay away from machine-learning, automation
- Facebook is huge privacy concern

Team-working: 
- Adopt and adjust into new environments 
- Attributes of mature teams - co-located, cross functional roles, self-organising, accountable and empowered, test and learn feedback loops
- Working with different departments - Business Analyst, Quality assurance/software testers, project managers, user experience team
- Projects are difficult - positive atmosphere, manage conflict intelligently, open and clear communication, respectful, trustworthy
- Justification of the project (Business case) 
-executive summary, 
-project summary, 
-risk assessment, 
-benefits and disadvantages of the project 
-execution timeline
-solutions/options
-stakeholders and communication
- examples of techniques for analysis: 
-MOST
-Boston Box
-Porters Five Forces
-PESTLE
-SWOT
-Interviews
-Workshops
-Questionnaires
- asking for requirements - users of the project

-  Return on investment (ROI):
-worth of the product to the people who need it
-understanding cashflows and how return on investment works on a year to year basis

- Risk - identifying risks to understand possible danger or impact positive or negative towards the project
- Understanding risk can help manage it, change the probability, eliminate and reduce the risk
- Risk identification tools - Brainstorming, prompt list, Delphi, SWOT, previous experience, 
- Some sources of risk - technology, team, scope, business, economy, competition 
- Dealing with risk - 
Avoidance, —— exploit
transfer, —— 	share 
reduce,  — enhance
accept,  — ignore

- Stakeholders:
-power/influence (high or low)
-interest (high or low)
-stakeholder attitudes - champion, supporter, neutral, critic, opponent, blocker

- Planning:
- Key to success in terms of project management
- Project plan, resource plan, financial plan, quality plan, acceptance plan, communications plan
- Project scope
