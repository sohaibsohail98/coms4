# Week 1: 19/06: Day 5:
Scrum Artefact and Even:
- *Framework* to develop and sustaining complex products
- People can address complex adaptive problems - while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible values
- Scrum artefacts - elements that help you share vital project information with group members:
Each element:
-Scrum values
-Scrum events
-Scrum roles
Scrum - project management framework based on agile methodology
Increment - Sum of all product backlog

- Scrum events: 

Sprint planning: A meeting that occurs at the beginning of a sprint, where the team looks at the product backlog and decides which items they want to work on throughout the sprint
 
The sprint itself starts as soon as the sprint planning has been completed and refers to the time period in which the team is working on the sprint backlog. Note that the sprint cannot last longer than four weeks.
 
Daily scrum: This is a daily 10-15 minute meeting where the development team would plan what they aim to work on during the next 24hrs. It also informs everyone what is going on across the team
 
Sprint Review: At the end of the sprint, the team presents the new features that have been introduced to the customer and receives feedback which will be useful for the next sprint.

Sprint Retrospective: An internal meeting where the team discusses the sprint and how they can improve the process for next time.


- Three key artefacts - 
-product backlog - list features of the product you’re developing, 
-spring backlog - describes what the team members should develop during sprint: - sprint retrospective - internal meeting reflecting on the project after its done
-product increment - product version delivered after each sprint to the stakeholders.

Definition of Done: This is an acceptance criteria that you have specified within your print

Scrum values - commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect
Scrum events - meetings that help teams discuss the development process - including sprint planning, daily scrum meeting, sprint review and sprint retrospective meeting
Scrum roles - Product owner, scrum master, development team 

Product owner - understand stakeholder needs and translated into product features: identify product features, does not need technical knowledge, keep the team in check, overseeing development process, product vision, management of product life cycle

Scrum master role - understand the principles of scrum and help the team out, should have the knowledge of agile values, supporting the product owner to realise the return on investment, encourage the team to be self-organised

Development team role - guiding people on the right path, two characteristics: 
self-organising - members know how to develop the product without any help from any non team member 
cross functional - all the skills required for product development and don’t have to depend on any non team member

Scrum principles: 
-Empiricism - Regularly check, monitor and adapt their workflows to make sure the project is heading in the right direction. 
-Self-organisation - be able to perform the tasks themselves without any input from non-team members
-Collaboration - interacting and working together to deliver high-quality increments
-Value based prioritisation - must prioritise the product 
-Time-boxing: Time acts as a constraint in Scrum to help teams plan and execute the project efficiently.
-Iterative Development: Scrum follows an iterative development model that helps teams include any change the customer needs in the product development process.

Network Diagrams:
-Task breakdown
-Estimation - different tasks will take different amounts of time. Keep a few days buffer, allows you to be on track
-Logical dependencies - Each task has a dependency on a previous task, some tasks are start-note which means it has no dependencies/predecessor 
-Network diagram allows us to see the logical order of activities and to define our critical path
If they are two starting points , you should start it with a 0 and then lead the other two points

-Activity on Node (AoD)
Earliest start ——- EST		!	Dur —— Duration
Latest time start — LST		!	Flt — Float

The time between latest start and earliest start = float
Early start + duration = Early start time
present latest start - duration of the predecessor note = Latest start of the predecessor note 
A critical part will be the one with zero free float
It is the longest path through the network - gives you a logical estimate on project length. 
The EST and LST is the same for end note
With multiple paths - use the maximum value note

Gantt Chart:
The collected information can be inserted into a Gantt chart enabling you to:
- Understand and control project schedules
- Communicate and present project information
- Organise work and people

Team-working: 
- Adopt and adjust into new environments 
- Attributes of mature teams - co-located, cross functional roles, self-organising, accountable and empowered, test and learn feedback loops
- Working with different departments - Business Analyst, Quality assurance/software testers, project managers, user experience team
- Projects are difficult - positive atmosphere, manage conflict intelligently, open and clear communication, respectful, trustworthy

- Justification of the project (Business case) 
-executive summary, 
-project summary, 
-risk assessment, 
-benefits and disadvantages of the project 
-execution timeline
-solutions/options
-stakeholders and communication

- asking for requirements - users of the project

-  Return on investment (ROI):
-worth of the product to the people who need it
-understanding cashflows and how return on investment works on a year to year basis

- Risk - identifying risks to understand possible danger or impact positive or negative towards the project
- Understanding risk can help manage it, change the probability, eliminate and reduce the risk
- Risk identification tools - Brainstorming, prompt list, Delphi, SWOT, previous experience, 
- Some sources of risk - technology, team, scope, business, economy, competition 
- Dealing with risk - 
Avoidance, —— exploit
transfer, —— share 
reduce,  — enhance
accept,  — ignore



- Stakeholders:
-power/influence (high or low)
-interest (high or low)
-stakeholder attitudes - champion, supporter, neutral, critic, opponent, blocker

- Planning:
- Key to success in terms of project management
- Project plan, resource plan, financial plan, quality plan, acceptance plan, communications plan
- Project scope
