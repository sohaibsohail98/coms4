Business week notes: 

SQ3R – How to be an effective reader! 

Read – Read the whole text quickly. Don’t stop. Even if there is something difficult that you don’t understand. 

Recall – Look back at your query questions. Can you identify which sections help you?

Review – Read important sections again slowly. Remember why are reading. Take notes so that you can remember helpful information and where you found it. 

Query – Ask yourself about each section. What do you expect to discover?

Survey – Scan the text and identify its structure. Do you need to read this text?
