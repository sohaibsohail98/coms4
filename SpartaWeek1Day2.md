- Fixing the top 20% reported bugs fixed 80% of errors and crashes.
- 20% of the code has 80% of the errors.
- 80% of your bugs can be fixed if 20% is focused on the code is optimised.

The power of listening:

Negotiations is about listening, successful ones listen more and talk less. 

Why listen? Moods can change, if you listen to someone, they are more likely to listen to you. Helps you understand the other person. In negotiations, you want to change the person’s mind.

It is essential to understand, connect and get an agreement. 
Listening is the golden key to open relationships. 

We listen to the underlining emotions, needs or wants. Once we were clear with his deeper needs, we understood both parties and gave both of them exactly what they want. This made them both happy. 

A lot of distractions in our mind, which means that it takes a lot of mental energy to listen to people. 

Prevent conflicts in the world: Listening
Children could learn listening at a young age. 
Listening can be a chain reaction, encouraging others to listen as well. Listen to the human being behind the words.

Levels of listening:
Deep
Active - talking a meeting
Conversational - talking to client
Cosmetic- banter

All the techniques of active listening
 
 1. Pay Attention
Give the speaker your undivided attention, and acknowledge the message. Recognise that non-verbal communication also “speaks” loudly.
 
Look at the speaker directly.
Put aside distracting thoughts.
Don’t mentally prepare a rebuttal!
Avoid being distracted by environmental factors. For example, side conversations.
“Listen” to the speaker’s body language.
 
 2. Show That You’re Listening
Use your own body language and gestures to show that you are engaged.
 
Nod occasionally.
Smile and use other facial expressions.
Make sure that your posture is open and interested.
Encourage the speaker to continue with small verbal comments like yes, and “uh huh.”
 
 3. Provide Feedback
Our personal filters, assumptions, judgments, and beliefs can distort what we hear. As a listener, your role is to understand what is being said. This may require you to reflect on what is being said and to ask questions.
 
Reflect on what has been said by paraphrasing. “What I’m hearing is… ,” and “Sounds like you are saying… ,” are great ways to reflect back.
Ask questions to clarify certain points. “What do you mean when you say… .” “Is this what you mean?”
Summarise the speaker’s comments periodically.
  
4. Defer Judgment
Interrupting is a waste of time. It frustrates the speaker and limits full understanding of the message.
 
Allow the speaker to finish each point before asking questions.
Don’t interrupt with counter arguments.

5. Respond Appropriately
Active listening is designed to encourage respect and understanding. You are gaining information and perspective. You add nothing by attacking the speaker or otherwise putting her down.
 
Be candid, open and honest in your response.
Assert your opinions respectfully.
Treat the other person in a way that you think she would want to be treated.
