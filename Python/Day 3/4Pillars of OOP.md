#Abstraction

```bash

when using methods in our code

def bark(self):
    return "woof"
    
print(fido.bark())
outcome - woof

```

#Inheritance
```bash
Animal - from animal class inherited:
atributes and functionalities 

snake inherited everything from the Animal class
from animal import animal

def __init__(self)
    super.init() # this refers to the parent class, which in this case refers to animal
    
snake(Animal)
print(animal.sleep())
```

# Polymorphism

```bash

we can inherite as well as override particular attributes or behaviour without affecting the parent class
```
#Encapsulation
```bash

making variable or even methods private to hide various aspects of the class form a user

def sleep():

```
