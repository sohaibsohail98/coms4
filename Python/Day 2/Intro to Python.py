# x = 10
# y = 11
# print(x == y) #Checking the values as Boolean resulting True or False,
# #10 does not equal to 11
# print( x!= y) #Checking the values as Boolean resulting True or False
# #This is true as x does not equal to 11.

# Real life example:

# age = 18
# print(age < 19)


# Single quotes vs double in Python
# Using double quotes is recommended, it can gets mixed up if we use single quotes.

# print('Ugne\'s class is Eng 67 ') #Singlequotes
#
# print("Ugne's class is Eng 67") #Doublequotes
