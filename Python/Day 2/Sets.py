# What are sets - sets are similar to lists
# What's  the difference: sets are unordered

# syntax: we use {} brackets

# Let's create a set

# car_par = {"wheels", "windows", "doors"}
# print(car_par)
#
# #add an item to the set
#
# car_par.add("seats") #This will add "Seats" to the sets.
#
# print(car_par)
#
# car_par.discard("windows") #This removes "windows" to the sets.
# print(car_par)
#
# frozen set

# Syntax - () store them in a variable
#
# counting = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4])
# print(counting)
