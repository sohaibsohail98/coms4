# print(hi[0]) #The indexing starts from the beginning(left)
# print(hi[-1]) #The indexing starts from the right
# print(len(hi)) #This grabs the amount of characters
# print(hi[0:6]) #This will only print the Hello
# print(hi[6:11]) #This will print the World
# print(hi[-5:11]) #This will print the World from the right

# print(remove_white_space.strip()) #This will remove any additional space.
# print(len(remove_white_space.strip())) #This is the updated length of the string after removing the white space
